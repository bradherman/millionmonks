== MillionMonks

MillionMonks is a pretty standard rails app that allows people to share their wisdom to pass onto others.  The app was built in a "weekend" (ie: only a few hours, but spread out over like two weeks) as an exercise on developing and launching a finished idea.

MillionMonks succeeded thanks to a few gems and plugins that were tied together to make it all function.  Authentication is handled by the ever popular authlogic gem.  Authorization is taken care of by Ryan Bates awesome cancan gem.  Voting is handled by the rails_3 fork of the vote_fu plugin.  Comments were originally built with acts_as_commentable, but eventually switched to Disqus.  Pagination is accomplished with the will_paginate gem, but may be switched soon to kaminari due to its better Rails 3 support.
